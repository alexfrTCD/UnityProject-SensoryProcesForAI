# UnityProject---Sensory-Process-for-an-AI-agent
Unity Assets from the Unity part of my dissertation - Human sensory process for an Artificial Intelligence

For setting up the project:
  1. Download Unity Hub.
  2. Download 2021.3.31f Unity Editor Verison.
  3. Create a 3D project.
  4. Add this Assets folder to the project created.
  5. Run the project. Now you will be able to move your agent using 'w','a','s','d' and rotate it using 'i','l','k','j'.

If you want to train the agent:
  1. Download the PyCharm project placed in my profile.
  2. While Unity Project is running and the agent is placed in position (0,0,0), execute the Python code.
